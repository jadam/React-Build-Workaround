# React-Build-Workaround

CRA is no longer supported, this is a workaround to build React project where the npm packages fail to compile the build. 

Eg. React project replace your node_modules folder with the one in this repository. 

npm install  
npm run build ( Install any missing packages if the build complains ) 

hopefully no issues and the build succeeds.
